\begin{abstract}
  We propose a proof methodology to verify the
  implementation of collection Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types
  CRDTs.
  %
  We firstly provide means to define the observable actions from the
  abstract specification of a CRDT by providing reference operational
  semantics for different CRDTs.
  %
  We then show how specifications can be made minimal by removing
  redundant information and retaining only the fundamental information
  to define the specification.
  This helps in simplifying our specifications.
  %
  Using these specifications we then show a generic technique to prove
  simulation relations between the specification and the implementation,
  hence establishing the correctness of the implementation.
  %
  To justify our approach we prove preexisting implementations of the
  operation-based RGA and two versions of the OR-set algorithm data
  structure.

  % We propose a correctness condition called Convergent Return-Value
  % Consistency.
  % We give a uniform method of generating abstract implementations from
  % specifications, and a method of constructing succinct abstract
  % implementation by forgetting redundant operations.
  % Then, we propose a method to prove simulation between implementation
  % and abstract implementation, and shows such simulation is equivalent
  % to a certain kinds of trace refinement.
