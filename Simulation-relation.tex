\section{Simulation Relation}
\label{sec:simulation relation}

In this section, we give our simulation relation between a implementation and a reference implementation. For plus-minus specification and its compacted reference implementation, we give our simulation between a implementation and a compacted reference implementation, and prove that from this simulation relation, we could obtain a simulation for the same implementation and the non-compacted version of reference implementation.
