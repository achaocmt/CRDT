To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a generic
operational framework for the characterization of CRDT specifications
under diverse delivery assumptions of the underlying network.
%

There have been many efforts in formalizing the semantics of
replicated data types~\cite{Burckhardt:2014,Burckhardt14b,ZellerBP14}.
%
Unlike these approaches, our proofs are based on standard simulation
arguments, common to proofs in programming languages
