\begin{abstract}
We propose a correctness condition called Convergent Return-Value Consistency. We give a uniform method of generating abstract implementations from specifications, and a method of constructing succinct abstract implementation by forgetting redundant operations. Then, we propose a method to prove simulation between implementation and abstract implementation, and shows such simulation is equivalent to a certain kinds of trace refinement.
