\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to provide a generic
operational framework for the characterization of CRDT specifications
under diverse delivery assumptions of the underlying network.
%

There have been many efforts in formalizing the semantics of
replicated data types~\cite{Burckhardt:2014,Burckhardt:2014b,ZellerBP14}.
%
Unlike the approach in~\cite{Burckhardt:2014,Burckhardt:2014b}, our
proofs are based on standard simulation arguments, common to proofs in
programming languages.
%

In~\cite{ZellerBP14}, the proofs provided are based on state-based
implementations of CRDTs, our work is concerned with operation-based
implementations.
%
Moreover, ~\cite{ZellerBP14} does not have a proof of RGA~\cite{RohJKL11}.

An important difference between our work and the aforementioned is
that to be able to express a simulation relation, we need to export at
the level of the operational specification the delivery assumptions of
the system.
%
In turn this means that our proofs are with respect to a more concrete
specification than these other works, since the delivery assumptions
are not apparent in their specifications.
%
We will consider in future work how to prove that out reference
semantics preserves the specifications \'a la~\cite{Burckhardt:2014}
where the delivery conditions have been removed.
%

There are works on the verification of program properties about
CRDTs~\cite{GotsmanYFNS16}.
%
We consider our work to be orthogonal to
those.
